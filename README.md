This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code and shows how to mitigate it using bounds checking.  The `bug.asm` file contains the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.asm` presents a corrected version.  The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking before accessing memory, making the program susceptible to exploitation if the value of `ecx` is maliciously manipulated. The solution adds bounds checking to ensure that memory access remains within the allocated region.
